Following is a list of projects (in no particular order) that I did during my time at IIT Bombay.


**ECG Amplifier** [(report)]({{ site.url }}/reports/ECG.pdf) [(video)]({{ site.url }}/reports/ECG.mp4)

ECG signals show the bio-potential generated by the activity of the heart. This signal can be very useful in diagnosing and predicting cardio-vascular diseases. However, these signals are quite small, and hence amplification is necessary. The ECG amplifier was built from scratch- from deciding which electrodes to use, designing amplifiers & intermediate stages to finally viewing the ECG signal.

**Hand Gesture Recognizer** [(report)]({{ site.url }}/reports/Hand_Gesture_Recognition.pdf)

Recognizing hand gestures has become quite an important task to build user-friendly advanced technology. A system which recognizes up, down, left, right and tilt movements is built in this project. IR sensors and a microcontroller are integral to the project. Additionally, a mathematical operation is attached to each movement and the output for it is displayed on a 7 Segment LED.

**Low-Cost Optical Tweezer**  [(some images)]({{ site.url }}/reports/Low_Cost_Optical_Tweezer.pdf)

Optical Tweezers are devices which are used to move microscopic objects like atoms, bacteria, droplets in a manner similar to what tweezers do. It consists of a highly focused LASER beam. But these devices are very expensive and can cost around $10,000, hence the motivation to develop a low cost alternative. This device involves a microscope, and since none of the existing models were compatible with the setup, a microscope (~400x) was developed from scratch, using components costing about $8. A DVD drive was used as a source for the laser for optical trapping, and its intensity was controlled using a circuit using a voltage regulator. Translational motion of the LASER was achieved by a bi-directional current.

The microscope, individually, comes in three models and will be provided to underprivileged schools to enable a better quality of education.

Update (Dec 2020): Awarded the **URA** (**Undergraduate Research Award**) for developing a low-cost microscope.


**Noise Cancelling Headphones** [(report)]({{ site.url }}/reports/Noise_Cancelling_Headphones_Project.pdf)

In today's busy and noisy world we like to go into a different zone while listening to music. However, more often than not the surrounding noise interferes us in this basic task as well. This motivates the need to have noise cancelling headphones. We design an appropriate closed loop control system for achieving noise cancelling, including designing appropriate gain stages and compensators.


**License Plate Recognition**  [(github)](https://github.com/ShubAn1901/Licence-Plate-Recognition)

Recognizing the characters on a license plate finds use in many applications like for security purposes and book-keeping. In this project a system is implemented which provides a bounding box around the license plate and recognizes the characters. A customized CNN, with cross-linkages and regression layers, was used. The model was trained end-to-end, providing a better performance.

**Where's Waldo?**  [(report)]({{ site.url }}/reports/Waldo_Project.pdf)

The pages of the book 'Where's Waldo?' when scanned with a very high resolution, serve as a good example of extremely cluttered giga-pixel images. The task was to find Waldo, Wenda and the Wizard in the images by forming a bounding-box around them. We used a non-deep method for the same. Interest windows were extracted using special features like Waldo's clothes and the shape of the Wizard's cap. The interest windows were then converted to HOG features. An SVM was trained at multiple scales for the final detection.

**Object Tracking**  [(report)]({{ site.url }}/reports/Object_Tracking_Project.pdf)

The ability to track objects has become an important element in various applications like tracking through CCTV cameras. In this project methods like mean-shift tracking and tracking using optical flow are explored. For optical flow we explore the Lucas Kanade Algorithm and its improvement using an iterative and a pyramidal algorithm. Then algorithms like the Hungarian Algorithm and a Kalman Filter (exploiting bounding boxes from YOLO) are explored.

**Multistage RISC Microprocessor**  [(code)](https://github.com/shubhangb97/RISC-Processor-design)

Designed and implemented a 6-stage multicycle pipelined processor on an FPGA. Instructions from the Turing complete IITB-RISC instruction set were included. A logic for hazard detection, data forwarding, stalling, etc. was included in the pipeline.

**Steganography using Wavelet Transform** [(slides)]({{ site.url }}/reports/Steganography_Project.pdf)

In today's world data security has become an important issue. Using this as a motivation we developed a system for steganographic concealing of one data into another using discrete wavelet transform. We made the process of steganography more secure by adding a novel patch based algorithm. We presented our findings at the MHRD-TEQIP-KITE workshop for knowledge incubation.

**Iris Recognition**  [(slides)]({{ site.url }}/reports/Iris_Recog_Project.pdf)

Matching a person with his/her iris can be one technique for personal identification. We preprocessed the data by performing Adaptive Histogram Equalization, normalization and occlusion removal. Then we employed PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the dimensionality of the data and LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) to match the person with his/her iris.

**Music Genre Classification** [(slides)]({{ site.url }}/reports/Music_Genre_Project.pdf)

The project aim was to classify music into 6 distinct genres. We used the MFCC coefficients, extracted from the music, as trainable features. We compared the results using CNNs, SVM and clustering techniques. -->
